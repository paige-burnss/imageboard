<h3><b>Project Proposal:</b></h3>

Imageboards have been around since 1999 and their appearances have barely changed at all since then. For instance, when in a thread the user is required to press a refresh button to fetch new posts and then scroll down to read them. They also need to install a third party browser extension to keep track of threads they've posted in to see if they've received any replies. This "thread watcher" is also quite primitive. The "catalog" view of active threads on a board is also completely static, requiring a manual refresh to see if there are any new threads or if a thread has been posted in, or "bumped". There's much to improve upon, many events that can be communicated with animations, making for a suitable project for this course.  We want to create an  imageboard web based application, where a user is able to search and  filter  visual content. A user has the ability to upload a variety of content and connect with the community and other visitors on the site by viewing, creating and  replying in threads/comments. It should be easy for the user to be able to also search through and keep track of their own thread, following discussion within a given thread. The interface should make it possible for any visitors/users to easily upload content and make it easy to integrate with the rest of the world. 

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.


## Limitations

Due to working with an immature tech stack and ecosystems, we were not able to connect the back-end, and the dictionary part in order to be able to switch lagauges.
There are still things remaining to fix in order to have all the linkings which we originally planned, in the different views. 
There also have certain limitations hen it comes to the scaling of different views.
For example today our application does not fully well scale well on a mobile device(there are soem spacing errors to go through in order to ensure that the scaling is flawless ).
